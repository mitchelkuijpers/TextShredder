Our root,
who art in Unix,
hallowed be thy shell.
Thy kernel come.
Thy commands be run
@localhost as they are in iNet.
Give us this day our daily updates,
And forgive us for our four-oh-threes,
as we forgive those who 403 against us.
And lead us not into segfaults,
but deliver us from /dev/null.
For thine is the Kernel, access, and 1337ness,
for ever and ever.
